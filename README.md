# A273-Ultracold_Quantum_Gases
Project code for lecture A273.

The primary file for the project is `interactive_solver.ipynb`.

In addition to the project, we give a program to solve the square well problem and an explanation for numerical round-off in the context of finding eigenvalues with the power-method (equivalent here to imaginary time-evolution).
